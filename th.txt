staticaly typed

	c,c++,java.....

dynamically typed...
	python,js...

c lang --->

ide --> vs code...
install --> python3 3.18.x

int x = 100;
100
int
 x = 100.90
100

float 10.20
10.20
float 20
20.0

narrow typecasting   float --> int 12.90 -> 12
broader typecasting  int --> float 12 -> 12.0

operators:
operators are the symbols which are used to perform the 
operations on operands
-------------------------------------------------------

1)unerary operators

2) binary operators
	bitwise operators
		& | ^ ~ << >>
	arithmetic operators
		+ - * / % // **

	comparision operators
		< > <= >= == !=

	logical operators
		and or not

	asingment operators
		= += -= *= /= %= //= **=

	memmbership operators
		in not in

	identity operators
		is is not




= asignment operators : right side value will be assigned to left side variable

loop:
entry controlled loop
	:for loop, while loop
exit controlled loop
	do while loop



functions:function is a block of code which is used to perform a specific task
	1)predefined functions
	2)user defined functions

	with arguments with return type
	with arguments without return type
	without arguments with return type
	without arguments without return type


def keyword is used to define the function
{block} -->

indentation --> 4 spaces

boiler plate code: 
a code which is used to perform a specific task and it is used as a template
